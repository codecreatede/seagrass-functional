# a streamlit seagrass application for monitoring the seagrass health genomics.

- built using python, javascript and HTML,CSS and currently supports the genome analysis

**To Do**
- each genes has its own page ad adding the javascript functions and details of those genes and graphics. **DONE**
- adding the enzyme kinetics and metabolic labelling. **CODE writing**
- adding support for the geospatial maps rendering from marine genome portal.
- inbuilt blast support and sequence retriveal system. **DONE**
- inbuilt support for the genome exploration and chunk genome analysis including phylogenomics. **CODE writing**

**Done**
- inbuilt seagrass genomics genes for health monitoring.
- inbuilt ethylene responsive genes.
- inbuilt light associated genes.
